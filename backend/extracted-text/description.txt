The drawing features a cartoon-style lizard depicted in a side view. The lizard has a long body, a pointed tail that curves slightly upward, and four rounded legs positioned to look like it is standing. Its body is predominantly colored green, with distinct zigzag-shaped white patterns running throughout its length, including the tail. These zigzag stripes alternate in a rhythmic fashion and add a sense of texture.

The lizard's head includes exaggerated round eyes with black pupils, giving it an expressive and slightly surprised look. Above the eyes are two thin black lines that resemble eyebrows, further emphasizing its lively personality. A simple curved black line represents the mouth near the front of the head.

Overall, the drawing is clean and playful, with the bold use of zigzag stripes and the expressive face being its standout features.
